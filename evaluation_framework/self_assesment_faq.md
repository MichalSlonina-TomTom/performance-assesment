# Completing Your Self-Assessment

**Source:** [TomTom Compass KB0020418](https://compass.tomtom.com/esc?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0020418)

## Introduction

At the end of each year, we ask you to reflect on your contributions and growth over the past year. Your direct manager will also assess your performance, setting the stage for a meaningful developmental conversation.

This page provides best practices in completing your self-assessment.

## Preparation

At least one month before the process kick-off, you’ll receive an email inviting you to start preparing for your year-end review.

This includes:

*   **Gathering feedback:** Continue to gather feedback from your main stakeholders and peers. Please use this guide to understand better how to request or give feedback on Workday.
*   **Collecting achievements:** Look for your key achievements and results, any artifacts and evidence to sustain them.
*   **Reviewing expectations:** Revise your performance expectations for the assessed period, your job profile, team goals and company objectives.
*   **Reflecting on performance:** Use these three questions as support—one for each performance pillar (Impact, Leadership, Capabilities and development):
    *   How well did I achieve the expected impact based on my role description, team goals, and company objectives?
    *   To what extent did I demonstrate leadership behaviors and integrate TomTom's principles into my work?
    *   How well did I meet my development goals based on the capabilities I built this year?
*   **Drafting your assessment:** Draft the main points of your self-assessment, following the 3 performance pillars structure.
    *   You can use the AI prompt attached to this article that will help you achieve that. You can find it under Attachments, in the right corner of this page.

> **Best Practice:** Drafting your self-assessment before we launch the process in Workday helps you stay on track and complete this step within the time frame we have each year.

All those details you are preparing will be filled in Workday as soon as we kick-off the process.

## Process Kick-off

The process is kicked off when you receive the year-end self-assessment task via Outlook and in your Workday Inbox.

1.  Click on the link from the email notification or go to Workday inbox to complete your self-assessment.
2.  Read carefully the guidance available before getting started.
3.  Click on **"Get started"** to move to the first section of the self-assessment.

## Self-Assessment Form Structure

The self-assessment form has 4 sections:

### 1. Performance Expectations

In this section you will see 2 important input points for your self-assessment:

*   **Feedback window:** A pop-up window with all the feedback you have received during 2025. You can make the page bigger to read it better or extract it in a CSV format.
*   **Performance expectations:** The performance expectations with a due date in 2025 and H1 of 2026.

If you have no expectations set in Workday, this section will be empty.

It is mandatory to have at least one relevant expectation in Workday for the assessed period. You can do that directly in this section, by using the **+Add** button.

> **Note:** You cannot submit the self-assessment form if you have no performance expectations in Workday for the 2025 performance cycle.

**Actions suggested for each performance expectation:**

*   Update the status (choose from *In progress*, *Not started*, *Completed*).
*   Add the progress, achievements, evidence in the 1st comment field or in the Activity notes.
*   Click on the **"Next"** or **"Back"** buttons to move between sections.

### 2. Performance Pillars

Use this section to reflect and rate yourself across the three performance pillars: **Impact**, **Leadership**, and **Capabilities & Development**.

Please check these extra guides on how to assess 2 of the performance pillars:

*   [Leadership](pillars/leadership.md)
*   [Capabilities and Development](pillars/capabilities_and_development.md)

### 3. Your Reflection on This Year

Take time to reflect on the past year and document how you’ve maximized your impact, demonstrated leadership, and strengthened your capabilities. Please follow the instructions provided in the form to structure ideas.

### 4. Review and Submit

Review the input you've provided in all previous sections. If everything is complete and accurate, simply click **'Submit'** to finalize your review.

## FAQ / Links

#### Q. Which is the connection between performance expectations and performance pillars and how to assess each of them?

We have observed two ways of setting performance expectations at TomTom:

1.  **3 performance expectations** for the entire performance cycle, one for each pillar. In this case, it is easy to decide the rating for each pillar.
2.  **Multiple performance expectations**, each broken down to highlight each pillar: the impact you will have by achieving that expectation, leadership behaviours you need to activate, and capabilities and development required to execute it.

If you use the latter one, you need to look at all the expectations you have set for that cycle, extrapolate for each performance pillar, and decide the overall rating for each of them.

You can have a systematic approach to doing that or a holistic one. Below is just an example; you choose the best way for you to tackle it.

#### Q. How will performance rating impact salary increase and bonus pay-out?

Salary increases and bonus decisions are made considering the performance rating, but also other objective criteria. We make sure there is a meaningful differentiation for those who exceed expectations. For TomTom'ers who receive “Improvement expected” as a performance rating, the annual salary increase will be possible only if there is an improvement in their performance by engaging in an Improvement Sprint or Improvement Plan.

#### Q. What happens if I have no Performance Expectations on Workday?

TomTom'ers can add Performance Expectations after the self-assessment process has been kicked off and finalize the process by following these steps:

1.  In the second section of the self-assessment form (Performance Expectations), click on the **+Add** button.
2.  Either set a new performance expectation or retrieve an existing/older expectation by selecting the **“Add existing"** option.

> **Note:** You need to have at least one expectation in Workday to submit the self-assessment form.

#### Q. What happens if I still have old expectations in place?

Workday will link automatically to the year-end review form only the performance expectations with a due date during the current performance cycle (Jan-Dec), and the first half of next year. If you have old expectations you would like to edit and re-use for this performance cycle, you can still do that by using the **+Add** button and manually adding and editing them.

#### Q. What happens if I am on leave during the self-assessment period, or I missed the deadline?

The closing date is a hard deadline for this step; still, you can connect with your manager and send them your reflection on this year via email, to take it into account at the manager assessment stage, and even to add it to the manager assessment form, or you can share your feedback during the year-end conversation.

#### Q. What happens if I recently moved to a new role, with a new manager?

The new manager and old manager need to align. The old manager should share the performance rating with the new manager, as the TomTom'er will be visible in the flow of the latter. Alternatively, delegation access can be arranged if the new manager doesn’t want to rate the mover.

#### Q. I am in the wrong supervisory organization in Workday.

Please contact your direct manager to check the right steps with the People team.

#### Q. My manager will be on leave. Is there anyone else who can perform the manager assessment on their behalf?

The task of performing the manager assessment can be delegated in Workday to the 2nd line manager. Your manager has the right in Workday to do this delegation, or the 2nd line manager can raise a Ticket to the People Team for this delegation.

#### Q. I don’t see all the feedback received in Workday, in the self-assessment form.

Attached to the self-assessment form, you will see only the feedback received during the current assessed period, Jan-Dec. If you believe there is feedback not attached to the assessment form, please check separately in **Workday > Talent and Performance > Feedback tab**.

#### Q. I have done my self-assessment but didn’t submit it.

The item will be pending in your Workday inbox. It must be submitted otherwise it won’t be received by the manager. You can submit it at any point before the closing date and time. After this date, the self-assessment form will be closed in Workday for your edits and moved to the manager assessment step.

If you use the **“save for later”** button, your input will be saved. Your manager will be able to see it, even if HRIT moves the process to the next step.

If you don’t save or submit your self-assessment form, anything you entered will be lost and your manager will not be able to see it.

#### Q. What happens if I submitted the self-assessment by mistake?

If you are still within the deadline, during the time slot allocated for the self-assessment, you need to raise a request on the People Team to have the self-assessment form re-opened.

If you want this to happen after the deadline for completing the self-assessment, reopening the form is not possible anymore. Please share it in a Word file or email with your direct manager, so they can add it in the manager assessment form, or just discuss it in the performance conversation.

#### Q. What happens if I’ve joined TomTom in Q4?

There is an eligibility rule for this process. TomTom'er seniority or hire date should be less than or equal to 30 September. This said, TomTom'ers who started in Q4 are not eligible for this process, as we need at least 3 months of work experience during the assessed period to receive a proper review and performance rating.

#### Q. What happens if I am on a long-term sick leave or other long-term leave?

You will receive in your Workday inbox the self-assessment form. If you cannot complete it before the closing date, your direct manager will receive the task of doing the manager's performance assessment for you. If during the assessed period you didn’t work for at least 3 months, your manager will ask the People team to cancel the process for you in Workday.

#### Q. I didn’t receive the email from Workday, nor the task in Workday for the self-assessment.

There is an eligibility rule for this process. TomTom'ers’ (no Interns or contractors) seniority or hire date should be less or equal to 30 September. This said, TomTom'ers who started in Q4 are not eligible for this process, as we need at least 3 months of working experience during the assessed period to have a proper review and performance rating.
