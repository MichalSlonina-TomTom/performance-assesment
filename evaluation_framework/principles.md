# TomTom Principles

## START WITH YES

Start with yes is about being open to ideas, signals interest and respect and invites connection. It energizes, creates safety and trust, and fuels creativity. Starting with yes doesn't necessarily mean ending with yes. It is about starting each conversation with positivity.

 

What it looks like:

- Listens before critiquing 
- Creates a safe space for ideation, innovation and creative problem-solving 
- Makes an effort to understand the core of another person's idea, exploring possibilities, before raising concerns

Examples:

- A team member suggests building a feature that seems overly ambitious. The product manager says: "Yes, I love that you're thinking about this user pain point. Let's explore what the core of this idea is. What if we broke it into phases?" Rather than dismissing it as impossible, they extract the valuable kernel and collaborate on making it feasible.
- When a client requests a last-minute change, instead of "That's not in scope," the project manager says: "Yes, I understand why this matters to you. Let's look at what's possible within our timeline and what trade-offs we'd need to make." This maintains the relationship while setting realistic boundaries.
- A developer wants to try a new framework. Rather than "We don't have time for that," the tech lead responds: "Yes, let's talk about what problems this could solve for us. Can you spike it out in a proof-of-concept this week?" This validates the enthusiasm while creating structure.

## IMPRESS THE CUSTOMER

Always think about the customer - whether an end user, intermediate, or colleague - and strive to do what's best for them. It is also about treating root causes, not symptoms, going for the structural solution, not workarounds, so issues are structurally solved and don’t reoccur. 

What it looks like:

- Always considers customer / stakeholder impact 
- Looks beyond just completing tasks to creating value
- Seeks to consistently understand customers, how their needs evolve and what improvements are needed in our products and internal processes

Examples:

- A support team member receives a request to add a "delete account" button. Rather than just implementing it, they ask "What happens to the user's data? Do they need to export it first?" They design a complete offboarding flow with data export, confirmation steps, and a grace period. The customer appreciates the thoughtfulness about their actual needs.
- A QA engineer finds a bug where form validation fails in certain cases. Rather than just logging "validation broken," they investigate and discover it affects three other forms too, all using the same validation library. They document the root cause, identify all affected areas, and propose a shared validation component. This prevents the same bug from appearing elsewhere.
- During a retrospective, team members mention they waste time manually completing certain processes. The team lead doesn't dismiss this as "just how it is" but works with a technical expert to automate the processes. By treating colleagues as customers and solving their structural problem, they improve everyone's daily experience.

## SIMPLIFY THE COMPLEX

Simplify the complex is about making things easy for others, asking the right questions, innovating, and communicating as simply as possible.

What it looks like:

- Understands what target audience needs and wants to achieve
- Asks the right questions to identify the right problems 
- Communicate offers, product features and solutions in a way that can be understood easily

Examples:
- A product manager presents a 10-page specification for a reporting feature. A developer asks: "What decision will users make with this report?" This single question reveals that users only need three key metrics, not the 20 originally specified. The team builds a simple, focused dashboard instead of an overwhelming data dump.
- Users complain that "the system is slow and confusing." Instead of defending the current design, a UX researcher asks probing questions and observes actual usage. They discover users can't find the search function and don't understand the filter options. The team adds a prominent search bar and simplified filters with plain language labels, dramatically improving satisfaction.
- A team sends detailed daily standup notes with technical implementation details to stakeholders. A team member asks "What do they really need to know?". The team comes together and decides to switch to a weekly summary showing completed features, upcoming milestones, and blockers requiring decisions. Stakeholders appreciate the clarity and respond faster to requests.

## BETTER EVERY DAY

Better every day is about continually learning, growing, and adapting, seeking and taking advantage of opportunities to build knowledge and skills.

What it looks like:

- Uses feedback to learn and make changes 
- Team members exchange information in various formats quickly and efficiently to stimulate innovation
- Ask more questions, sign up for learning programs, reflect on failures and ask for help if needed

Examples:

- After presenting at a team meeting, a product manager asks specific questions: "Was I clear about the priorities? Did I give you enough context?" They keep a notes file of feedback themes and work on one improvement area each month.
- While debugging a complex issue, an engineer realizes they're learning things that aren't documented anywhere. They simultaneously fix the problem and write clear documentation with diagrams, helping both their future self and colleagues.
- A senior developer receives feedback that their code reviews feel critical rather than educational. They adjust their approach to include explanations of "why" and links to resources, turning each review into a teaching moment that helps junior developers grow.

## DISAGREE AND COMMIT
Disagree and commit is about driving constructive debate, working through ideas to arrive at a decision, and committing to making it happen.

What it looks like:

- Speak up and respectfully challenge ideas and decisions if we disagree, supporting our views with sound rationale
- Offer constructive ideas and once a decision has been made, commit to the idea's success even if it was not originally yours

Examples:

- A team member argues that daily standups are unnecessary and proposes asynchronous updates instead, sharing research on remote team productivity. When the team decides to keep daily standups, they attend consistently and contribute meaningfully rather than showing reluctance or disengagement.
- Two interviewers disagree on a candidate—one sees potential while the other has concerns about technical depth. After discussing observations thoroughly and deciding not to move forward, the advocate accepts the decision and focuses on finding other strong candidates rather than revisiting the debate.
- A designer pushes for a more polished UI with animations and micro-interactions, believing it's essential for user experience. When the team decides to ship with basic styling to meet the deadline, they commit by ensuring the simplified version still meets quality standards and documenting the enhancements for future iterations.
