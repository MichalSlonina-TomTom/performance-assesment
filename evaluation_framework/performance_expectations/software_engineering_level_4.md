# Job Description

The Software Engineer IV can solve most or all the engineering problems in the scope of her team without guidance. She estimates effort and identifies risks with competence and confidence and drives technical and priority decisions that reinforce the product strategy and bring value sooner. She takes ownership of the team’s success—supporting more junior team members in delivering on expectations, actively adjusting her own priorities as needed and leading change and innovation to continuously improve the team’s ability to make an impact. Because most of the engineering problems worth solving can be solved by Software Engineer IV, there is no hard limit to the impact she can deliver by continuing to learn and deepen her expertise, both on the domain and on her engineering skillset. There is no expectation that she strives for further promotion into either the management track or to Staff Software Engineer. She understands that she needs to own both her growth and finding opportunities to have impact if she deliberately decides to pursue that path.

- TT shaped skills, where SW engineering fundamentals are coupled with deeper knowledge of multiple, or connected technologies.
- Accountable for successful delivery of own work, actively supporting other team members’ work and growth.
- Showing accountable and influencing behavior for fit-for-purpose implementation of processes, policies, and governance in the team by being a true role model.
- Showing leadership by taking ownership of major team-internal responsibilities, leading major team-internal changes, or small team-external responsibilities/changes.
- Supporting hiring for team vacancies and investments into team and product health.
