# Job Description

The Software Engineer II has gained a solid software engineering skillset and has a foundational understanding of the product and the systems her team owns. She consistently delivers individual work packages and small product improvements with little to no guidance, knows how to operate the team’s systems in typical situations and is an active member of the team’s on-call rotation. She understands the impact of her own deliverables and actively contributes to solution and system designs within the scope of them. She makes continual investments into her own growth and seeks to work on product improvements that push her outside of her comfort. She seeks out and is open to guidance from her teammates. She may require team support to continue to grow, but the time invested by her team does not exceed the value of her contributions.

- Limited T shaped skills, combining SW engineering fundamentals with deeper knowledge of specific technology.
- Showing accountable behavior for successful delivery of own work.
- Showing leadership by taking ownership of and improving small team-internal processes and ways of working or by leading small team-internal changes.
