# TomTom's performance management framework

TomTom wants every TomTom'er to feel their performance and development are
prioritized, empowering them to take the lead in their careers. We believe that
performance can be distilled down to three pillars, each of them having an
equal weight:

- Leadership
- Capabilities and development
- Impact

In addition to that TomTomers should adhere to the core principles.
