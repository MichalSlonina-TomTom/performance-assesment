### Capabilities and development

Capabilities & Development is how you improve - it is building capabilities in yourself to ensure you have the right skills and are actively engaged in helping others to develop. 

The Capabilities & Development pillar augments Leadership, giving TomTom'ers the opportunity to show how their unique set of capabilities contributes to their success. We expect all TomTom'ers to be developing capabilities in themselves to learn, upskill and reskill to ensure they are successful and are contributing to the development of others. 

Everyone is responsible for their own development. That can be through formal training, but also through learning on the job which includes assignments, challenging projects, and learning from peers and mentors. 

In assessing this pillar, we look at:

- The unique set of skills, knowledge and abilities an individual brings to their role
- How these capabilities contribute to achieving results
- Individual's commitment to continuous learning and development
- Foster TomTom's learning culture by engaging with learning initiatives, mentoring, and championing growth.

To assess the Capabilities & Development pillar, follow this systematic approach:

#### Review role-specific competencies: Access the competency framework in Workday and identify required competencies for the role of individual being assessed. 

Questions to consider:

- What are the required competencies for this role?
- What proficiency levels are expected?
- Have role requirements changed during the review period?
 
#### Gather evidence of capabilities:

Collect and summarize concrete example of how the employee demonstrated the competencies, as well as record of trainings and certifications completed. 
Evidence sources can be:

- Feedback from Workday, verbal or written 
- Project debriefs
- Actual observations (problem solving, work artifacts) 

#### Assess proficiency levels using TomTom Academy: Use the "Request Review" for managers and peers to assess skill level and "Review Skills for self-assessment. 

Best practices:

- Reviews the behavioral indicators for each level
- Ensure that review rating is supported by clear evidence
