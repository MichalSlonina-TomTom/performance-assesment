Leadership

The manner in which you achieve results. We encourage to apply the leadership behaviors and principles, from the TomTom Leadership Foundation.

Impact alone is not sufficient for high performance; it also require leadership. We care not only about the impact achieved, but also how you achieved it. At TomTom, we give every TomTom'er the opportunity to show leadership. Our Leadership Behaviors and Principles in the Leadership Foundation represent our expectations for how leadership is shown to make sure our pursuit of impact is not a short-term affair but rather is helping everyone achieve their fullest potential while strengthening the culture we all value. 


#### OWNERSHIP

Ownership is about taking initiative, being committed to our customers, partners, and colleagues, inventing solutions, and thinking big and long-term.
 

What it looks like:

- Commits to getting things done, solving problems, helping customers and achieving goals
- Perseveres when encountering challenges
- Looks for opportunities to drive improvement or initiatives, sometimes even outside of direct scope of responsibilities

Examples:

- An IT specialist notices recurring system errors affecting productivity. They conduct research to find the best possible long-term solution. They collaborate with their team to implement the solution and significantly reduces downtime.
- During a critical project phase, the team leader falls ill. A team member steps up, taking charge of coordination and communication activities with stakeholder, ensuring the project stays on track. 
- An engineer sees a potential roadblock in a process and suggests an improvement. They implement the improvement, resulting to better product quality and cost savings. 

#### ACCOUNTABILITY

Accountability is about being responsible for the result, as well as being proactive, authentic, and committed to achieving team and individual goals.

What it looks like:

- Transparent about goals, plans and progress
- Open to being evaluated and to continuously improve 
- Uses feedback to implement necessary changes when needed

Examples:

- Member of a project team realizes mid-sprint that they won't complete their assigned tasks due to underestimating complexity. They proactively inform impacted stakeholders, proposing a revised timeline with specific deliverables they can commit to.
- An engineer receives critical feedback during code review pointing out security vulnerabilities. Rather than becoming defensive, they acknowledge the oversight and quickly implement a fix. They also document the lesson learned for future reference.
- A product manager realizes their product roadmap timeline was overly optimistic and the team won't meet the promised launch date to stakeholders. They proactively schedule a meeting with leadership and affected teams, present a transparent analysis of what went wrong in their planning process, take responsibility for the miscalculation, and deliver a revised timeline with more realistic milestones and risk mitigation strategies.

#### INFLUENCE

Influence is about having an impact on the behaviors, opinions, and choices of others to leverage performance and positive results and create positive change.

What it looks like:

- Tries hard to understand what motivates others - colleagues and customers - and uses this knowledge enhance performance and improve results
- Builds trust and positive relationships, creating a positive work environment
- Inspires other through vision and action

Examples:

- A procurement partner sees potential cost savings in contract that is due for renewal. They gather data, conduct analysis and prepare at least 3 different alternatives to the contract owner, which they use for negotiating the contract renewal that is more beneficial for the company.
- A senior engineer wants the team to adopt a new testing framework but faces resistance to change. Rather than mandating it, they build a small proof-of-concept demonstrating 50% faster test execution, host a lunch-and-learn session to address concerns, and gradually gain buy-in from skeptical team members through demonstration and patience.
- A product manager believes the team should pivot from a requested feature to addressing user onboarding friction. They gather user research data, create prototypes demonstrating the retention impact, and facilitate a workshop with stakeholders where they collaboratively reach consensus on the new direction without pulling rank.

#### MULTIPLYING

Multiplying is about using your expertise intelligently to amplify and bring out the capabilities of those around you.

What it looks like:

- Positively and constructively participates in discussions and decision-making
- Provides feedback to colleagues, with the intention of helping them become better
- Shares best practices with team members and/or peers, acts as mentor that supports the growth of others

Examples
- A senior account manager observes that some junior account managers are losing deals during contract negotiations. They investigate to understand the root cause and personally coaches the juniors through their more difficult negotiations. They also create a system to match juniors with senior account managers for mentoring, building a team where everyone can confidently navigate difficult contracting conversations.
- A talent acquisition partner sees that only a few engineers conduct effective technical interviews, creating hiring bottlenecks. They develop an interview training program with question banks and evaluation rubrics, certify 15 engineers as interviewers, and establish a mentorship system where experienced interviewers coach newer ones, tripling the company's interview capacity.
- A finance reporting specialist notices department heads struggle with monthly budget reviews and often miss optimization opportunities. They create simple templates and training sessions that teach non-finance leaders how to analyze their own spending patterns, enabling teams to make faster, smarter financial decisions without constantly needing finance approval.
