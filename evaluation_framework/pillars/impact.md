### Impact

The outcomes of your actions, the value you bring to the product,
customer, your team, etc.

Impact is determined by the consequences or outcome
of what you do - doing things is not sufficient.

You must do the right and smart things, the things which align with and advance
our strategy and business goals to achieve impact. 

Impact is also the value you bring to customers, employees, shareholders, or
partners, expressed in impact terms.

We expect TomTom'ers to be smart, curious, and ambitious in seeking out those
activities which maximize impact.

This requires research, collaboration, awareness, and ambition to narrow down,
of the many things we could do, what were the things which were most impactful.
